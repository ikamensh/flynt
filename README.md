`flynt` is a command line tool to automatically convert a project's Python code from old "%-formatted" and .format(...) strings into Python 3.6+'s "f-strings".

F-Strings:

> Not only are they more readable, more concise, and less prone to error than other ways of formatting, but they are also faster!

### Installation

`pip install flynt`. It requires Python version 3.7+.

### Usage

*Flynt will modify the files it runs on. Add your project to version control system before using flynt.*

To run: `flynt {source_file_or_directory}`

* Given a single file, it will 'f-stringify' it: replace all applicable string formatting in this file (file will be modified).
* Given a folder, it will search the folder recursively and f-stringify all the .py files it finds. It skips some hard-coded folder names: `blacklist = {'.tox', 'venv', 'site-packages', '.eggs'}`.

It turns the code it runs on into Python 3.6+, since 3.6 is when "f-strings" were introduced.

### Command line options

From the output of `flynt -h`:

```
positional arguments:
  src                   source file(s) or directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         run with verbose output
  -q, --quiet           run without output
  --no-multiline        convert only single line expressions
  -ll LINE_LENGTH, --line-length LINE_LENGTH
                        for expressions spanning multiple lines, convert only if the resulting single line will fit into the line length limit. Default value is 88 characters.
  -d, --dry-run         Do not change the files in-place and print the diff instead. Note that this must be used in conjunction with '--fail-on-change' when used for linting purposes.
  -s, --string          Interpret the input as a Python code snippet and print the converted version. The snippet must use single quotes or escaped double quotes.
  -tc, --transform-concats
                        Replace string concatenations (defined as + operations involving string literals) with f-strings. Available only if flynt is installed with 3.8+ interpreter.
  -f, --fail-on-change  Fail when changing files (for linting purposes)
  -a, --aggressive      Include conversions with potentially changed behavior.
  -e EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...], --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]
                        ignore files with given strings in it's absolute path.
  --version             Print the current version number and exit.
```

### Pre-commit hook

To make sure all formatted strings are always converted to f-strings, you can
add flynt to your [pre-commit](https://www.pre-commit.com) hooks.

Add a new section to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```
-   repo: https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt/
    rev: ''
    hooks:
    -   id: flynt
```

This will run flynt on all modified files before committing.

You can skip conversion of certain lines by adding `# noqa [: anything else] flynt [anything else]`


### Configuration files

Since v0.71 flynt can be configured using `pyproject.toml` file on a per-project basis. 
Use same arguments as in CLI, and add them to `[tool.flynt]` section. CLI arguments takes precedence over the config file.
It can also be configured globally with a toml file located in `~/.config/flynt.toml` on Unix / `~/.flynt.toml` on Windows.

### About

Read up on f-strings here:
- https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/

After obsessively refactoring a project at work, and not even covering 50% of f-string candidates, I realized there was some place for automation. Also it was very interesting to work with ast module.

### Dangers of conversion
It is not guaranteed that formatted strings will be exactly the same as before conversion.

`'%s' % var` is converted to `f'{var}'`. There is a case when this will behave different from the original -  if var is a tuple of one element. In this case, %s displays the element, and f-string displays the tuple. Example:

```
foo = (1,)
print('%s' % foo) # prints '1'
print(f'{foo}')   # prints '(1,)'
```

Furthermore, some arguments cause formatting of strings to throw exceptions. One example where f-strings are inconsistent with previous formatting is %d vs {:d} - new format no longer accepts floats. While most cases are covered by taking the formatting specifiers to the f-strings format, the precise exception behaviour might differ as well. Make sure you have sufficient test coverage.
